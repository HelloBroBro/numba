Built-in CUDA target deprecation
--------------------------------

The CUDA target built in to Numba (under ``numba.cuda``) is deprecated in
favour of further development in the NVIDIA ``numba-cuda`` package. Backward
compatibility is maintained between ``numba-cuda`` and ``numba.cuda``, and no
user code changes are needed.
